In a bowl, mix eggs until no whites remain, then season with salt and pepper.
In a medium pan over medium heat, melt butter. 
Pour in eggs and tilt pan so eggs fully cover the entire pan.
 As eggs start to get cooked, use a spatula to drag cooked edges into center of pan. 
 Tilt pan to let uncooked egg fall to the edge of the pan. 
Once the bottom is set, but top is still a little wet, sprinkle cheese on one half of omelet.
 Fold other side over the cheese and slide omelet onto a plate.
